There are a total of 6 stations on the table.\r\n- After than some custom automation shapes a few wires, and peels a few adhesive gaskets, while the robot picks up components and assembles all the pieces. (again, sorry for the non-disclosure, it's really cool to watch).\r\n- Finally, after the parts go through all 6 stations, the finished product comes back out to the operator.\r\n- All of this takes place faster than the operator can load, so the only limiting factor is the operator itself.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMichael Kohlmann (@kohlmann0)\r\n\r\n",
