# RoboticAssemblyCell
This is a location to store documentation regarding a robotic assembly cell I designed an built for an employer.
There isn't really any code or files here, it's just a placeholder for the Git-Hub Pages site. 
The actual website is in the gh-pages branch of this repository.
If you want to see the website itself goto: https://kohlmann0.github.io/RoboticAssemblyCell/

Thank you,
Michael Kohlmann
